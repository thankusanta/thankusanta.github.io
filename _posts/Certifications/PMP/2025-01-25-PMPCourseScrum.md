#### 출처(참고)

##### SCRUM PROCESS TERMS


- **Scrum**: is a work approach that emphasizes regular reassessment of plans in short, iterative phases with daily communication.

- **Product Backlog**: 
    - The Product Backlog enables the team to prioritize work and store it until it's ready for a sprint.
    - The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. 
    - It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. 
    - The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.

- **Sprint Backlog**: 
    - The Sprint Backlog is the team's work forecast. It is the team's only focus during one sprint.
    - The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. 
    - It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint.

- **Sprint**: starts with sprint planning and ends with a retrospective, usually lasting 1 to 4 weeks. DA suggests 1-2 weeks and uses the more agnostic term "iteration".

- **Daily Scrum**: is where team members can raise issues, report progress, and ask questions. It's called a daily coordination meeting in DA.

- **Sprint Review**: 
    - demos the team's completed work to stakeholders and receives feedback. DA uses the term iteration review.
    - The Sprint Review is an event at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint.

- **Increment**: becomes a part of the overall solution. The sprint effort is a consumable solution in DA.

- **Sprint Retrospective**: 
    - is a final reflective point to evaluate the process as a whole and ask questions like "What went well?", "What didn't go as planned and why?", and "What can be improved?"
    - The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It occurs after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning.
