- **[정답] 4 weeks** 
- $$ \text{평균 속도}= {29 + 30 + 31 \over 3} = 30 \text{ points per iteration} $$
- $$ \text{작업 완료 소요 기간 : } {60 \text{ points} \over 30 \text{ points per iteration}} = 2 \text{ iteratoins} $$
- $$ \text{배포 소요 시간 = 2 iterations x 2 weeks per iteration = 4 weeks } $$

### 4. A sponser has learned that an agile team is tracking its development capcity using story points and velocity metrics. The sponsor recommends creating a team bonus to incentivize increasing team velocity scores. What should the sponsor consider when deciding to implement this idea?

- This may created competition between separate teams. 
- This would lead to a lack of cooperation among team members 
- This would align the team member goals with the project goals.

### 7. QA new member of an agile development team believes it is unfair to track defect counts at the team level when the continuous integration tool identifies the developer associated with each logged defect. The team member thinks it would be more beneficial to identify the root cause of the problems and track defects at the developer level. How should this be answered? 
- Agree, if the tool provides this information, that the source of defects should be identified so they can be corrected earlier. 
- Explain that tracking defects at the team level encourages team members to collaborate and help each other. 
- Clarify that not all work items are of the same difficulty, and some will naturally have more defects than others. 
- Warn that this could lead to conflict within the team as it would identify the worst performing team members.
