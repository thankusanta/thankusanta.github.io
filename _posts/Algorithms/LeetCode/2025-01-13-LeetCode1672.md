## Problem

You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i​​​​​​​​​​`<sup>​`th`</sup>​ customer has in the `j`​​​​​​​​​​<sup>​`th`</sup> bank. Return the **wealth** that the richest customer has.
A customer's **wealth** is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum **wealth**.

### Example 1:

> **Input:** accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]  
> **Output:** 6  
> **Explanation:**   
> `1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`     
> `2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`    
> Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each,   
> so return 6.

### Example 2:

> **Input:** accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]    
> **Output:** 10    
> **Explanation:**   
> 1st customer has wealth = 6  
> 2nd customer has wealth = 10   
> 3rd customer has wealth = 8  
> The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

### Example 3:

> **Input:** accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]    
> **Output:** 17

### Constraints

- m == accounts.length
- n == accounts[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- 1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100

            sum = 0;
            for(int money : account){
                sum += money;
            }
            wealth = Math.max(wealth, sum);
        }

        return wealth;        
    }
}
```
